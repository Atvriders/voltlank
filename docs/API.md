# API reference

Base URL: `https://<your-host>/api/v1`. All responses are JSON; collections
use `{ data: [...] }`, single resources `{ data: {...} }`, errors
`{ error: { code, message } }`. Auth is a session cookie (`vl_session`) plus a
CSRF header (`X-VL-CSRF`) for mutating requests — the SPA handles both
automatically.

Machine-readable spec: [docs/openapi.json](openapi.json) (also served at
`/api/docs` as JSON).
