# Testing

## Layers

| Layer | Tool | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unit | Vitest | `apps/api/test/`, `apps/web/src/**/*.test.ts(x)` |
| API | Vitest + supertest against PostgreSQL | `apps/api/test/` |
| E2E | Playwright (desktop + Pixel 7 mobile) | `tests/e2e/` |
| Visual regression | Playwright snapshots | `tests/e2e/` |
| WebGL assets | Playwright + GLB validation | `tests/e2e/webgl-assets.spec.ts`, `blender/scripts/validate_assets.py` |
| Security | auth/CSRF/rate-limit tests | `apps/api/test/` |
| Legacy content | grep-based scan | `scripts/legacy-scan.ts` |

## Running

```bash
npm test                          # unit + API (needs test DB)
npx prisma migrate deploy         # once, against the test database
npm run e2e                       # Playwright (API on :3111 required)
npm run legacy:scan               # fails on leftover pre-rebrand content
```

## E2E details

`playwright.config.ts` defines two projects (`desktop`, `mobile`) against
`http://127.0.0.1:3111`. The suite:

- registers fresh users, enables demo mode, walks the whole product
- asserts the command lifecycle is visible (`Queued → …`)
- verifies the WebGL showroom loads **real GLB assets** (not the procedural
  fallback) for all five vehicle classes
- collects console errors and fails on unexpected ones

Start the target server before the suite:

```bash
cd apps/api && PORT=3111 node dist/index.cjs
```

## Visual regression

Snapshot pages under `tests/e2e/` using Playwright's `toHaveScreenshot` for:
sign-in, onboarding, overview (desktop + mobile), live vehicle, WebGL
fallback, map, drives, charging, battery, automations, fleet, public status,
incident, admin, settings, dark/light themes, reduced-motion, provider outage,
and command pending/failure states.

## Blender assets

`blender/rebuild_all.sh` regenerates the five vehicle GLBs (+ LOD variants and
thumbnails) and fails if any asset is missing parts or invalid. CI validates
the committed artifacts with `python3 blender/scripts/validate_assets.py`.

## CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs: typecheck, lint, unit/API tests (PostgreSQL
service), E2E, asset validation, `npm audit` gates, Docker image build +
Trivy scan + SBOM, and GHCR publishing on `main`.
